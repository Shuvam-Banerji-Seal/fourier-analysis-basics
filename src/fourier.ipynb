    "In this project, we will discuss what sound is, how to represent it mathematically & in a computer, and how to examine its frequency content using the Fourier Transform. The latter will be implemented in SageMath, a free open-source computer algebra system as superset of Python which bundles many great libraries like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and more. With the help of filter matrices, the frequency spectrum of a sound can be manipulated. This is demonstrated with some sample sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This projected is intended for educational purposes, i.e. we don't focus on performance of our code (for that, see the FFT algorithm implemented in system-level languages like Rust or C++). Basic knowledge of linear algebra as well as Python are required. The key points are explained next to the code. The reader is encouraged to experiment with the code and the provided sound samples.\n",

    "In the seminar, it might have come across as if Sage was a totally different programming language than Python. In fact, on the [SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/library-press.html), we find this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Leverages Existing Software: SageMath does not reinvent the wheel for every known calculation. When possible, it uses existing tools to solve the problem and combine all of them in one unique interface. This concept not only exposes software packages to a wider audience, but also helps to increase the quality by submitting bugs upstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "> SageMath uses Python as its \"glue language\" to interface with all its components. Python is also SageMath's primary interface language and hence SageMath does not invent a new programming language as other mathematical software systems do. Python is well established among research communities and makes interfacing even less complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, SageMath uses Python as \"glue language\". In fact, it provides a unified Python interface to many great libraries in the scientific community, among other: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `Maxima`, `BLAS` etc. (see also [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-general.html#why-did-you-write-sage-from-scratch-instead-of-using-other-existing-software-and-or-libraries)).\n",

    "This is not valid python syntax. You cannot name a variable f(x) in Python and to raise a number to a power, you use `**` instead of `^`. In SageMath, however, you can do this. This is because SageMath is a superset of Python, i.e. it extends the syntax of Python with some niceties like this one to make your life easier. Technically, Sage includes a [preparsing](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#sage-preparsing) step to convert the special syntax to valid Python code. If you want to dive deeper, [this is the Python method](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/ffbbea9cb2360340f1c5517b590883fdaf02575c/src/sage/repl/preparse.py#L1382) responsible to parse statements like the one above."

    "We hear sounds every day - the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, music, people talking. Physically speaking, sound is a pressure wave that propagates through a medium like air. Variations in air pressure near our ears cause our eardrums to vibrate. Through some more processes, these vibrations are converted into electrical signals that are sent to our brain, which interprets these signals as sound. The frequency (number of variations per seconds) of these pressure waves determines the pitch of the sound we hear. The amplitude of the pressure wave determines the loudness of the sound. As an example, consider the following sine wave and experiment with its parameters to see how they affect the sound:"
